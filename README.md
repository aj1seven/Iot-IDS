# 🛡️ Deep Learning-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This project implements a comprehensive Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using deep learning models. It covers three critical IDS types:

- **Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**  
- **Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**  
- **Custom Rule-Based IDS**  

Each component is trained to detect malicious behavior, prevent intrusions, and improve overall cybersecurity posture.
